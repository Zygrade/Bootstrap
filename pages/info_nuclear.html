   <h4 class = "display-4">THE</h4><p class="lead">electrical power can be generated by means of nuclear power. In nuclear power station, electrical power is generated by nuclear reaction.
Here, heavy radioactive elements such as Uranium (U235) or Thorium (Th232) are subjected to nuclear fission. This fission is done in a special apparatus called as reactor.
Before going to details of nuclear power station, letâ€™s try to understand what is fission?
In fission process, the nuclei of heavy radioactive atoms are broken into two nearly equal parts. During this breaking of nuclei, huge quantity of energy is released. This release of energy is due to mass defect. That means, the total mass of initial product would be reduced during fission. This loss of mass during fission is converted into heat energy as per famous equation E = mc2, established by Albert Einstein.<br></p>

   <p class="lead">The basic principle of nuclear power station is same as steam power station. Only difference is that, instead of using heat generated due to coal combustion, here in nuclear power plant, heat generated due to nuclear fission is used to produce steam from water in the boiler. This steam is used to drive a steam turbine. This turbine is the prime mover of the alternator. This alternator generates electrical energy. Although, the availability of nuclear fuel is not much but very less amount of nuclear fuel can generate huge amount of electrical energy. This is the unique feature of a nuclear power plant. One kg of uranium is equivalent to 4500 metric tons of high grade coal. That means complete fission of 1 kg uranium can produce as much heat as can be produced by complete combustion of 4500 metric tons high grade coal. This is why, although nuclear fuel is much costlier, but nuclear fuel cost per unit electrical energy is still lower than that cost of energy generated by means of other fuel like coal and diesel. To meet up conventional fuel crisis in present era, nuclear power station can be the most suitable alternatives.

   <h4 class="display-4"> Advantages : </h4><br>
   <p class="lead">1. As we said, the fuel consumption in this power station is quite low and hence, cost for generating single unit of energy is quite less than other conventional power generation method. Amount of nuclear fuel required is also less.<br>
   2. A nuclear power station occupies much smaller space compared to other conventional power station of same capacity.<br>
   3. This station does not require plenty of water, hence it is not essential to construct plant near natural source of water. This also does not required huge quantity of fuel; hence it is also not essential to construct the plant near coal mine, or the place where good transport facilities are available. Because of this, the nuclear power station can be established very near to the load centre.<br>
   4. There are large deposits of nuclear fuel globally therefore such plants can ensure continued supply of electrical energy for coming thousands years.<br></p>
   <br><h4 class="display-4"> Disadvantages : </h4><br>
   <p class="lead">1. The fuel is not easily available and it is very costly.<br>
2. Initial cost for constructing nuclear power station is quite high.<br>
3. Erection and commissioning of this plant is much complicated and sophisticated than other conventional power station.<br>
4. The fission by products is radioactive in nature, and it may cause high radioactive pollution.<br>
5. The maintenance cost is higher and the man power required to run a nuclear power plant is quite higher since specialist trained people are required.<br>
6. Sudden fluctuation of load cannot be met up efficiently by nuclear plant.<br>
7. As the by products of nuclear reaction is high radioactive, it is very big problem for disposal of this by products. It can only be disposed deep inside ground or in a sea away from sea shore.<br></p>
